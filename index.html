    <h3>Personal Information </h3>
    Student: Praniv Basnet <br>
    Student Code: s3840254 <br>
    Background: Nepal <br>
    Email:s3840254@student.rmit.edu.au <br>
<br>

    <p>My name is Praniv Basnet, born in Nepal but I have been in Melbourne since I was 6 years old. My parents decided to leave Nepal in hopes of a better future in 2008, since then we have been back twice for holidays. I do speak Nepalese at home with my parents however it isn’t the most fluent and I am also not able to read or write in Nepali, I can only speak it and of course I can speak English which I would say is my main language. In terms of my academic studies, I have mainly been invested in business ever since high school. I was awarded the dux in my year 12 graduation for the highest score out of my year level in business management, hence why I choose the Bachelor of Business Entrepreneurship as my major in RMIT. In my second year of university, the ability to choose our own minors became possible and due to my mind solely being focused on business, I choose to do marketing as a minor and did so till this semester. I personally didn’t enjoy marketing as it seemed mostly self-explanatory content. My interest towards business is also supported by the fact that my family owns a restaurant which helps me see firsthand how a business Is run and gives me a real-world aspect of business as opposed to just theory learnt in class.  I am now in my third and last year of my major.
        My hobbies include a variety of different things, I mainly love to play video games as they are fun to play and can help you relax and playing with friends is even better. I also enjoy being outdoors and used to play soccer back in high Scholl but nowadays I mostly go to the gym and hang out with friends. A sport that I have been watching and been interested in recently is Mixed Martial arts especially the UFC which is the biggest organisation for the sport.

<h3>Interest In IT</h3>  <a id="Interest" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<p>My interest in IT in my final semester was because I felt like marketing as a minor wouldn’t do much for me, hence I choose IT because it is a skill which can be very useful, and there many jobs relating to it. It is also a subject which a lot of my friends picked and whilst they mentioned that it was a lot of work, they also told me it is a crucial skill which is highly in demand today. It can also lead to many high paying jobs. For me I also thought that it could help with my own business endeavours such as being able to create a website myself and learning how to code can lead into different business ideas. For my first semester I choose Introduction to IT and Introduction to programming, prior to this I have no real experience in IT other than the required classes taught back in high school. Due to this it has been a bit difficult to understand everything, but it has been interesting, and I do feel like I am developing a skill which keeps me motivated to keep learning. I expect to learn to create a website and learn how to code in python and see if I find it interesting enough to continue down the IT path.</p>

<h3>Ideal Job in IT </h3> <a id="Ideal" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<p>An ideal job, considering the subjects I am currently undertaking could be a Business IT Analysist, as it is in both the business and IT field.
    This current position is for Dws Limited in Mlelborune and the reason it appeals to me is because of the money and because it seems to combine the skills of both business and IT. <br> The role is essentially described as the bridge between IT and business, A Business IT analyst would generally gain requirements from stakeholders, analyse these requirements, and create functional specifications (Modern Analyst).
    The skills required for the job consists of having great communication and to be able to work in a variety of different business sectors such as the retail sector or the financial sector. It also requires for me to have experience in the business analyst field already and to be able to adapt into different situations and be flexible while maintain a great attitude in work. It is also desired that an individual looking for this job to be familiar with and be able to work with frameworks such as Scrum and have qualifications in IIBA or CBAP which stand for International Institute of Business Analysis and Certified Business Analysis professional. Both qualifications relate to having the skill of a business analyst where CBAP is a certificate for individuals.
    <br>The skills I currently have do not meet the requirements mostly due to my lack of experience in the business analyst field. I also need to gain a CBAP certification which seems can be done online and provides me with the skills necessary to stand out to employees by showing the dedication to the profession and it also demonstrates that I have the knowledge and experience as an efficient and effective professional in business analysis. To earn this CBAP however there are many requirements such as a minimum of “7500 hours of business analysis work experience in the last 10 years” and also a “minimum of 35 hours of professional development in the last 4 years”, (IIBA), whilst there were more requirements these two stood out to be as they seem the most time consuming. In terms of the communication skill and attitudes skill required, I feel that I have the attitude aspect as I am very easy going and am always willing to adapt and learn different things. <br>This is because I feel that there is always something more to learn and improve yourself in different areas or in a same area with things you might have been unfamiliar with. In terms of communication, I feel that I do have very fluent English and am also confident to talk with co-workers or even stakeholders. One area that I may have to improve upon though is my public speaking, which is technically a part of great communication skills, this is because it is very nerve tracking to talk to many people at a time and sometimes these nerves can get to me. To overcome this, I could take public speaking classes or even now in RMIT take the initiative to speak up during these classes and try and communicate effectively and efficiently in group work with people I have never worked with.

<h3>The Myers-Briggs 16 personality Test </h3>
<p>In this Test I was outlined as a debater, which is someone who exercises their quick witted and broad knowledge base. </p>
<h4>Strengths and Weaknesses </h4>
<p>The strengths that were identified were that debaters are knowledgeable, quick thinkers, charismatic and excellent brain stormers whilst their weaknesses include, being very argumentative, insensitive, and intolerant and can find it difficult to focus and can dislike practical matters. I can relate to this test as I do like debating with friends and others and showcasing the knowledge I may have around a certain topic, and I would also say that I am quick-witted and able to come up and brainstorm ideas quickly and easily.
    In terms of the weaknesses however I wouldn’t say I am insensitive or intolerant in any regards although I do agree that I may be argumentative at times and do find it realty hard to focus.  I am the type of person who has an opinion with backed up research and data which I think is correct and will try to have conversations and or debate with those I disagree with to try and get their viewpoint to change so I do believe this test was mostly accurate in certain areas.
<br>
<h4>Summary </h4>
<p>To summarise this test, it showed that debaters have vivid imagination and a powerful intellect and can overcome many obstacles which might seem unbeatable to others. Their thinking and rationality may also lead to many misunderstandings which have happened with me and my friends or family when talking, but with further communication the misunderstanding is able to be sorted out, but initially I do experience that the things I say may not be the clearest at times to those listening.

<h3>Online learning style test</h3> <a id="Learning" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<p>In terms of my online learning style test in which I choose to do on the education planner test, the results showed that I was a visual and or a tactile learner rather than an auditory learner. It means that I learn better when I physically see things and I am often good at visualising things, and I am attracted to language which is rich in the imaginary aspect like a story which does relate to me. This I because I find myself paying more attention when I can create a clear picture of what the person is saying in my head.
    The other main aspect of my leaning style was Tactile which means I also learn a lot of form doing something and touching rather than just theory. It means I also like to communicate by touching and I appreciate physically expressed forms of encouragement. In this regard it means I should combine visually seeing and imagining something with doing the physically partaking in tasks to learn more effectively and efficiently.

<h3>The Big 5 Personality Test </h3> <a id="Test" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<p>This test measures the dimensions of my personality, and it identified the following 5 personalities as the results of my answers. They were Openness (58%), Conscientiousness (67%), Extraversion (71%), Agreeableness (67%) and Neuroticism (62.5).
<br>A higher score in openness would mean that I would enjoy arts and seek out complex forms of self-expression, which my score was towards the lower spectrum as I find art great to look at but also boring. Although I do find everyone’s different self-expression appealing as it is fascinating to see how different everyone is and how everyone single person operates differently and have a variety of ways to express themselves.
<br><br>My conscientiousness was a high score which relates to my self-discipline the ability to really focus and chase down ones goal no matter the obstacle in their way. This does resonate with me in some way as I do pride myself in going to the gym most days and I also like to start my work early and not wait till the last second to get it finished. Although I could also get better in this area as I sometimes let obstacles get in my way or get lazy and unmotivated which has hindered my progress. This can be very detrimental to one’s mental health hence this is an area I could work and improve upon.
<br>The other skill Extraversion describes ones need to gain external stimulation, basically being an extrovert and wanting to be the centre of attention, whilst I do speak a lot and like making people laugh and have bursts of energy where I feel more extroverted, I do also love being by myself. I feel very calm and relaxed alone and really allows me to focus on what is important rather than what those around me may think is important.
<br>Agreeableness relates to an individual’s ability to put others needs before them, this is something I do, as I tend to care about my friends and family a lot and I feel like the bond you share with someone is very special. I don’t see this as an area to improve upon as I see this as a positive trait for one to have.
<br>Neuroticism is a person’s tendency to experience negative emotions, while I do think of myself a very positive and mostly happy person in many circumstances, I have had moments of negative emotions. These were emotions which I wasn’t really used to because I am not used to having these emotions. I do tend to overthink which can then impose a greater negative reaction. The overthinking is something I would say I could improve on and to really try to not give attention, energy and time to things that are out of my control.

<h3>Project Idea</h3>  <a id="Idea" data-hs-anchor="true"></a>
<h4>Overview </h4>
<p>The project idea is a fitness app by the name of Fit for All Purposes which is an app that provides customers with a calorie diary in which they can calculate their calories for the day. It will provide fitness routines and advice as well as mental health advice and exercise hence the name Fit for all purposes. Many other fitness apps focus mainly on the fitness aspect which is why this app goes into the mental health aspect as it is as important if not more than physical health especially with all the problems going in the world the last couple of years. The app will also contain image detection technology so the calories of foods can be determined via images being taken of the ingredients that go into the food as well as some information provided by customers such as the size of the ingredients, this is so the image detection can deliver accurate results
</p>
<h4>Motivation </h4>
<p>The motivation of this product is to help people achieve their fitness goals and to bring about the importance of mental health into people’s lives so they can be aware of their own mental situation and to provide them with exercises and techniques to help them. Poor mental health is a huge problem everyone must deal with at some stage in their life, no matter your age or status and it can be detrimental in someone’s life. Depression is massive problem and plays a role in more than one half of suicide attempts (Halverson, 2020). People experience daily stressors, and many don’t know how to cope with these stressors and ultimately let them all build up which is why Fit for all purposes wants to tackle this problem and provide the necessary tools to better mental health. Fit for all purposes will provide mediation online videos, breathing techniques clam music and positive messages to better users’ mental health. Research around breathing techniques and meditation have shown to reduce anxiety and treat symptoms of depression and improve heart health (Majsiak, 2019). Poor mental health can even start to impact physical health as depression has been linked to chronic illnesses such as asthma, cancer, and cardiovascular disease (WebMD, 2021). This is also the same vice versa as poor physical health can also increase the chance of mental health problems, exercise and eating well have also both been identified as measures to help people with both their physical and mental health (Unknown, 2022). The other aspect of the motivation behind this app is because of the poor food choices everyday people make and their lack of exercise, in Australia alone, 67% of adults are overweight or obese (Obesity Evidence Hub 2021), it is a major health problem that results in decreased life expectancy especially for those that are younger (Djalalinia et al, 2015). The purpose of Fit for All Purposes was to try and tackle both these issues and provide people with an app that will benefit them in being healthy in every aspect. </p>
<h4>Description</h4>
<p>Fit for All purposes are a fitness and mental wellbeing app which will provide customers with fitness and mental wellbeing advice and programs which will help them rah their fitness goals.  The importance placed on mental wellbeing is huge due to poor mental health being a major cause of depression and being one of the reasons for poor physical health. Fit for all purposes will be free however it will have a premium for $10 a month which will get rid of advertisements shown on the app and will include 1 on 1 online talks with a professional in the fields of the customers choosing such as a fitness expert or nutritional expert or mental health expert. This will ensure customers are able to communicate with someone with a great field of knowledge in relation to the goal they are trying to achieve as fitness apps are more effective when they are personalised to the user (Barna, 2018). This feature is locked behind a paywall due to the high quality of information provided by these experts and the time they must put in to help the customers they are assigned to. These experts will stay in contact with customers and update their regimes and diet if they think it needs to be updated for a real personalised experience. Customers will be able to ask these experts any questions and may be asked question themselves by the experts so they can create the best routine that suits the customers fitness level and their schedule and their fitness ability. This will be the same with the nutritional information as our diet experts will be able to provide advice regarding starting and meaning a diet and even providing recipes or food to try remove form their current diet. Customers will get the ability to choose or decide their own diet, the nutritional team will just help users with what ever they decide for example if they choose a ketogenic or vegan diet.
    The free version of the app will however come with the calorie diary but not with the image detection, instead they will have to add food via a search within the app as a huge database of foods and ingredients will be in the app. It will also include the mental health aspect for free which includes mental health exercises and techniques being shown and customers will have the ability to turn their notifications on for the app, which allows the app to send customers positive and motivational messages throughout the day to help customers with their overall wellbeing. The science behind this is the self-affirmation theory which mentions that by thinking positive thoughts about ourselves will ultimately change the narrative in our head that we are what the positive affirmations are telling us (Moore, 2022). In this regard the messages our app sends will remind users that they are doing their best and send them motivational and positive messages to keep these positive affirmations alive and constant in their head.
    In terms of the image recognition of food in our apps, a nutritional label scanner and OCR and UPC would be beneficial. Both would be used in tandem to recognise foods via an image and recognise foods via a barcode hence bring more efficient and effective for users who are updating the food they have eaten for the day in their calorie diary.
</p>


<h4>Tools and Technologies </h4>
<p>The main technology needed for this app would be for the image recognition of food portion. This process would require a large team of image taggers and a data team to firstly collect millions of food images, and then label and organise them (Sheworks, 2021). Image recognition essentially gives eyes to computers and can be used via the algorithm convolutional neural network. This network looks at the pixels of the image and proceeds to extract the important features using the convolutions, which is the combination of two functions leading to a third function. The Convolution Neural Network (CNN) can be made via Pytorch with the basic steps being to firstly normalise and load the test data, define the CNN. Define the optimiser and loss function, training the model on the data and finally testing the model on data (Neo, 2021). In terms of the Ocr, it identifies light and dark patterns which make up letters and numbers to turn scanned images into text (Minolta, 2018). UPC on the other hand which stands for universal barcode (Ward, 2020) would be scanned via the app to get the calories and nutritional info of the food on the app in a clean and user-friendly way, which would help users easily see serving sizes and the amount of macro nutritional in the product in relation to their portion sizes.</p>
<h4>Skills Required </h4>
<p>One of the main skills required would be experts in the fields of fitness and nutrition. These would be personal trainers and dietitians with a lot of experience and the ability to spend their day by giving advice to users online. A skill that would also be needed is to be able to create a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) which requires python coding knowledge, so someone could be hired to do this or i could learn and try to create it myself. Another alternative to this is partnering with Passio who also use OCR and UPC and their own Passions Nutritional label scanner to recognise branded food and packaged products, they are also partnered with another fitness app which is popular called MyFitnessPal (Passio, 2022). Personal trainers and dietitians and mental health experts with a lot of experience shouldn’t be hard to find, especially since most of the work they do will be interacting with customers online and through email which can make their daily life more flexible. Coders to help program the CNN should also be easy to find, but the partnership with Passio would be a lot easier and more efficient considering they already have experience with a fitness app.
</p>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>If this app is successful, then many users of the app will be on their way to achieve their goals and will be fit both physically and mentally. Success means peoples daily lives are improved, their lives saved and ultimately means they will be happier. This positivity within customers would then be brought into other aspects in their life which could help them in these other ventures. Fit for all purposes is designed to firstly help people and lower the obesity rate caused by poor physical health and diet choices and or lack of information in these areas and to tackle the problem of depression and poor mental health. </p>
